```swift
import Fastlogs
import FastlogsClient

let config = try? FastlogsConfig(
  endpoint: "<your-fastlogs-endpoint>", // E.g. http://localhost:3001
  appId: "<your-app-id>"
)
let client = FastlogsClient(useConfig: config)
```

By default, we store credentials like ID Token and Refresh Token in the Keychain. Thus the user doesn't need to sign in again when he returns.

To turn off this behavior, set `usingPersistStorage` to `false`:

```swift
let config = try? FastlogsConfig(
  // ...
  usingPersistStorage: false
)
```

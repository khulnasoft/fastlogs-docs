Calling `/api/fastlogs/sign-out` will clear all the Fastlogs data in memory and cookies if they exist.

After signing out, it'll be great to redirect your user back to your website. Let's add `http://localhost:3000` as one of the Post Sign-out URIs in Admin Console (shows under Redirect URIs).

### Implement a sign-out button

```tsx
<button onClick={() => window.location.assign('/api/fastlogs/sign-out')}>Sign Out</button>
```

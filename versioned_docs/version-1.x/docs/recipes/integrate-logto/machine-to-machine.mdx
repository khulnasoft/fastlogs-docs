# Machine to Machine: Auth with Fastlogs

<AppNote type="Machine to Machine" />

## Intro

Machine to Machine (M2M) is a common practice to authenticate if you have an app that needs to directly talks to resources. E.g., an API service that updates users' custom data in Fastlogs, a statistic service that pulls daily orders, etc.

Usually, an M2M app doesn't need user interactions, i.e., it has no UI.

:::info
Fastlogs does not currently support the M2M app to represent a user. The `sub` of the Access Token will be the App ID.
:::

## Fetch an Access Token

### Locate the App ID and App Secret

On the application details page, locate the App ID and App Secret.

#### Accessing Fastlogs Management API

If you want to use this app for accessing [Management API](/docs/references/core/#management-api), remember to turn on "Enable admin access" in the Advanced settings tab.

### Locate the API Resource

In the API Resource tab, find the API identifier that the app needs to access. If you haven't added the API Resource in Fastlogs or don't know what API Resource is, see [API Resource](/docs/references/resources).

:::info
Fastlogs Management API is a built-in resource with the fixed identifier `https://api.fastlogs-docs.khulnasoft.com`.

### Compose and send the request

Then compose them into a request (**all mandatory**):

- Use Token Endpoint (`https://your.fastlogs.endpoint/oidc/token`) as the request endpoint, and use `POST` as the method.
- Set header `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- Use [Basic authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization#basic_authentication), where username is the App ID, and password is the App Secret.
- Carry the body data:

```json
{
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "resource": "https://shopping.api", // Replace with your API identitfier
  "scope": "scope_1 scope_2" // Replace with your desired scope(s) if you're using RBAC
}
```

If you are using cURL:

```bash
curl --location \
  --request POST 'https://your.fastlogs.endpoint/oidc/token' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic eW91ci1hcHAtaWQ6eW91ci1hcHAtc2VjcmV0' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  --data-urlencode 'resource=https://shopping.api' \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=scope_1 scope_2'
```

Replace `https://your.fastlogs.endpoint` with the Fastlogs endpoint you are targeting. For Fastlogs Cloud, it will be `https://[tenant-id].fastlogs.app`.

### Token response

A successful response body would be like:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbG...2g", // Use this token for accessing the resource
  "expires_in": 3600, // Token expiration in seconds
  "token_type": "Bearer" // Auth type for your request when using the Access Token
}
```

## Access resource using Access Token

You may notice the token response has a `token_type` field, which it's fixed to `Bearer`. Thus you should put the Access Token in the `Authorization` field of HTTP headers with the Bearer format (`Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`).

For example, if you have requested an Access Token with the resource `https://api.fastlogs-docs.khulnasoft.com`, to get all applications in Fastlogs:

```bash
curl --location \
  --request GET 'https://your.fastlogs.endpoint/api/applications' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG...2g' # Access Token
```

Replace `https://your.fastlogs.endpoint` with the Fastlogs endpoint you are targeting. For Fastlogs Cloud, it will be `https://[tenant-id].fastlogs.app`.

## Authentication

If you are protecting your own API Resources other than Fastlogs Management API, remember to implement the authentication in your resource. See [Protect your API](/docs/recipes/protect-your-api#validate-the-api-requests-authorization-token) for details.

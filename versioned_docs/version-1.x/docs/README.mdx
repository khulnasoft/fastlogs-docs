- An OIDC-based identity service

- Various sign-in options, such as social, email, phone number, and username, including passwordless authentication
- The management API that is ready to use and can serve as your authentication provider
- SDKs that can integrate your apps with Fastlogs quickly
- Flexible connectors that can be scaled with community contributions and customized with SMAL, OAuth, and OIDC protocols
- RBAC for scalable role authorization to control your resources for diverse use cases
- User management and audit logs help you understand user identity-related information and keep your security on track.

Our problem space is commonly referred to as "[customer identity access management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_identity_access_management)" (CIAM) or "customer identity solution." While these terms may not be the most exciting, they accurately describe the focus of our work.

## Basic concepts

To better understand how Fastlogs works, it can be divided into four parts: Admin Console, Sign-in Experience, Core Service, and SDKs.

- The **Admin Console** is a web app that allows you to manage your resources and sign-in experience.
- The **Sign-in Experience** is the user interface that your end-users interact with, including signing in and creating an account etc.
- The **Core Service** is the foundation of Fastlogs and provides essential APIs to support all other features.
- The **SDKs** serve as bridges between your application and Fastlogs.

Admin Console is the easiest way to customize and manage Sign-in Experience and Core Service, and we'll use it across the tutorial. And it is available in both [Fastlogs Cloud](https://cloud.fastlogs-docs.khulnasoft.com/) and Fastlogs Open-Source.

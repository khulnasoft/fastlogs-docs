# ðŸ–¥ Using Fastlogs CLI

## Get started

Fastlogs CLI provide a conveneient way to install, maintain, and update your Fastlogs instance without handling those boring tech stuff manually.

:::note
Currently we don't ship binaries, thus Node.js `^18.12.0` is required in the environment.
:::

### Install CLI globally

Install via your preferred package manager to use `fastlogs` command globally:

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm i @fastlogs/cli -g
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @fastlogs/cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add -g @fastlogs/cli
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can always append `--help` to show the help info of each command:

```bash
fastlogs --help
fastlogs db seed --help
```

### Local CLI

A built-in version of CLI is shipped with every Fastlogs release since v1.0.0-beta.11. Say you already have a Fastlogs instance in `~/fastlogs`, then you can run the commands below:

```bash
cd ~/fastlogs
npm run cli # Invoke the local CLI
```

Note if you want to execute with options, you need to prepend a `--` BEFORE the options for Fastlogs CLI, e.g.:

```bash
npm run cli db seed -- --db-url postgresql://your-database-url
```

### Use CLI by `npx`

Another way to use Fastlogs CLI is `npx`, which can execute a package without installation.

```bash
npx @fastlogs/cli
```

This will be helpful for one-off invocations, e.g.:

```bash
npx @fastlogs/cli db seed --db-url postgresql://your-database-url
```

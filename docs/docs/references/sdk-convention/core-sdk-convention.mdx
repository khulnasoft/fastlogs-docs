# Core

## Basic Conventions

- The core should contain platform-independent functions only.
- The core should be named as `{$language}` and under the repository root directory. E.g., `fastlogs/js/js`, `fastlogs/kotlin/kotlin`.
- The core package should be named as `{$language}` under Fastlogs scope. E.g., `@fastlogs/js`, `io.fastlogs.sdk:kotlin`.

## Basic Requirements

Any core SDK should contain:

- Types
- Utility functions
- Core functions

### Types

<CoreTypes />

### Utility Functions

<CoreUtilityFunctions />

### Core Functions

<CoreFunctions />
